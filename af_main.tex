\begin{abstract}
While non-linear activation functions play vital roles in artificial neural networks, it is generally unclear of how non-linearity can improve the quality of function approximations.
In this paper, we present a theoretical framework to rigorously analyze the performance gain of using non-linear activation functions for a class of residual neural networks (ResNets). In particular, we show that when the input features to the ResNet are assumed to be uniformly chosen from the functional spaces, using the non-linear activation functions to generate the ResNet output averagely outperforms the linear activation functions, and the performance gain can be explicitly computed. Moreover, we show that when the activation functions are chosen as polynomials with the degree much less than the dimension of the input features, the optimal activation functions are precisely the Hermite polynomials. This demonstrates the role of the Hermite polynomials in function approximations for ResNets.

\section{Introduction}
% importance or advantage of activation function
Non-linear activation functions
are essential to the expressive power of the neural network.
The current approach to design
activation function is mainly empirically motivated.
For example, to obtain better representation of features, it is a common practice to optimize over parameterized activation function \cite{ramachandran2017searching}.
Such optimization increases the computational cost with little network performance gain \cite{laudani2015training}.
Another shortcoming of this approach is that the searched activation function cannot be guaranteed for other problems.
In addition to empirical study, there are also theoretical investigations which study specific network architecture.  Many researches are restricted on a specific activation function and seldom explore about the theoretical property of activity function, which is important to the expressive power of neural network. For example, \cite{AroraBMM18} focuses on studying the number of layers and hidden units while choosing ReLU activation function. Our study fills the theoretical gap by studying how the activation function reduces the neural network loss.

In particular, our work is not restricted to specific function but only assumes the activation function is smooth.
In our study, the activation function is chosen from the space which contains non-linear functions ``near" the linear space.
By doing so, we can compute quantitatively the network loss using second order approximation.
To simplify the analysis, we consider the one-node neural network which outputs one-dimensional feature \cite{dey2018approximation}. The network we considered can be regarded as a special ResNet model, which are widely used in deep neural network architecture.
% This network can be regarded as a kind of non-linear regression.
We use an averaged error to measure the network loss, which can be regarded as an universally optimal activation function for the given network.
We find that the averaged loss is minimized when the activation function is Hermite orthogonal polynomial, which
has been argued only empirically to be beneficial as activation functions in previous work \cite{ma2005constructive}.


To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that can explicitly quantify the performance gain in functional approximation, and provide the closed-form solutions of the optimal non-linear activation functions for certain classes of neural networks.

% passive and active
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section \ref{sec:mm}, we formulate the universally optimal activation function problem
mathematically.
Under some assumptions we derive optimal solution as the Hermite polynomial and find the expression of error rate in Section \ref{sec:hp}.
Furthermore, in Section \ref{sec:er}, numerical experiments are conducted to verify our theoretical results.
Section \ref{sec:con} concludes the paper. Proof details of main conclusion are provided in \ref{sec:Proofs}.

Throughout this paper, we use $X$ to represent random variables;
$\underline{X}$ to represent random vectors;
$\bm{X}$ to denote random matrix;
$x$ to represent a numerical value;
$\underline{x}$ as a numerical vector;
$\bm{x}$  or $\mathbf{M}$ as numerical matrix; $\mathbf{I}_n$ is n-dimensional identity matrix;
$[\cdot]^\T$ is the transpose operation on matrix; $\ide{i}{j} = (i+j)\, \mathrm{mod} \, 2$
which equals 1 if $ i + j$ is even and 0 otherwise;
$n!!$ is the double factorial which equals $n \times (n-2) \dots \times1$ if $n$ is odd and $n \times (n-2)\dots \times 2$ for even $n$. Furthermore, $(-1)!!=1,(-3)!!=-1$.

\section{Mathematical Model}\label{sec:mm}
We consider one-node neural networks, whose structure is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ns}.
This type of network arises naturally from function approximation problems, where a target function $g$
is estimated by $\sigma(\sum_{i=1}^k w_i f_i)$ and the domain of definition for $f_i, g$ is a finite set.

To formulate the problem using neural networks, we consider a $k$-dimensional random vector $\underline{X}=(X_1, \dots, X_k)$ and a random variable $Y$.
Our goal is to predict $Y$ using the neural network with $\underline{X}$ as input.
To be more specific, $Y$ is approximated by $ \sigma(\sum_{i=1}^k w_i X_i)$.
For a given problem, we have $n$ data pairs $(x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$, and
the $\ell_2$ loss function is given by
$\ell_2(\underline{y}, \bm{x}) = \norm{\underline{y} - \sigma(\sum_{i=1}^k w_i \underline{x}_i)}^2 $
where $\underline{x}_i= (x_{1i}, \dots, x_{ni})^\T$ is the $i$-th column of the feature vector $\bm{x}$ and
$\underline{y} = (y_1, \dots, y_n)$ is the label vector. $\sigma$ is applied to a vector in elementwise way.
The optimal weight for a given activation function $\sigma$ is the solution to $\min \ell_2(\underline{y}, \bm{x})$.



For different problems, we suppose $\underline{y}, \bm{x}$ are drawing from some distribution $G$.
That is, we treat them as random vectors and rewrite them as $\underline{Y}, \bm{X}$.
We are interested to find a function $\sigma$ which minimizes
$\E[ \min \ell_2(\underline{Y}, \bm{X})]$.
Our requirement of the activation function $\sigma$ is that
$\sigma(z) = z + \epsilon \xi(z)$ where
$\epsilon$ is a small constant. The non-linear term should satisfy the normalization constraint
$\E[\xi(\bm{X}\underline{w})]=1$ where
$\bm{X}\underline{w} = \sum_{i=1}^k w_i \underline{X}_i$ is the matrix-vector product with  $\underline{w}=(w_1, \dots, w_k)$.

We formulate the universally optimal activation function $\sigma$ as follows:
\begin{definition}\label{def:ug}
Suppose $G$ is a distribution space for $(\bm{X}, \underline{Y})$,
$F$ is a function space for $\xi(z)$.
$\mathrm{E}[\sigma]$ is called the averaged estimation error whose definition is
\begin{align}\label{eq:ug}
\mathrm{E}(\sigma) = & \E[ \min_{\underline{w}} \norm{\underline{Y} - \sigma(\bm{X} \underline{w})}^2] 
%s.t. \,& \sigma(z) = z + \epsilon \xi(z) \nonumber \\
%&\E[\norm{\xi(\bm{X}\underline{w})}^2]=1
\end{align}
The function $\sigma^*$ which minimizes $\mathrm{E}(\sigma)$
is called the universally optimal activation function for the single node neural network.
\end{definition}

Definition \ref{def:ug} is a general formulation for any distribution space $G$.
To get some analytical result we should choose some specific distribution.
In the following analysis, we assume $\underline{Y}$ follows Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\frac{1}{n} \mathbf{I}_n)$ and
we choose $\bm{X}$ as uniformly distributed random orthogonal matrix \cite{eaton1989group}. The choice of $\bm{X}$ can be regarded as the post-processing result of can simply PCA (Principal Component Analysis): If each element of $\bm{X}'$ is i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ random variables and $\sigma(\bm{X}'\underline{w}')$ is considered, we can make the transformation $\bm{X} = \bm{X}'(\bm{X}'^\T\bm{X}')^{-1/2}, \underline{w} = (\bm{X}'^\T\bm{X}')^{1/2}\underline{w}'$. We see that $\bm{X}'\underline{w}' = \bm{X}\underline{w}$.
From \cite[Proposition 7.1]{eaton1989group} $\bm{X}$ is a random orthogonal matrix.
Further we assume $\underline{Y}$ and $\bm{X}$ are independent.
This defines our distribution space $G$. Such choice is natural and leads to simple expression of the averaged error for linear function.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:linear}
We have $\mathrm{E}(\sigma_0) = 1 - \frac{k}{n}$ where $\sigma_0(z) = z$ is the identity function.
\end{proposition}

Proposition \ref{prop:linear} says that the averaged estimation error $\mathrm{E}$ for linear function is equal to $1-\frac{k}{n}$.
This result is consistent with our intuition
since we use $k$ degrees of freedom to estimate arbitrary vector in $n$-dimensional space.



We have analyzed the averaged error for linear function. To extend our result on general non-linear functions, we need to choose a proper function space $F$. By detailed analysis we consider a local regime which contains functions near to linear function. The distance between non-linear and linear function is quantified by a positive value $\epsilon$. Thus we consider $F_{\sigma_0}(\epsilon) =\{ \sigma \,|\, \norm{\sigma - \sigma_0} \leq \epsilon\}$. Then all differential functions can be treated as $\cup_{\epsilon>0} F(\epsilon)$. The norm is actually the expectation w.r.t. the distribution space $G$. That is, $\E[\norm{(\sigma - \sigma_0)(\bm{A}\underline{Y})}^2] \leq \epsilon^2$
where $\bm{A} = \bm{X}\bm{X}^\T$.


We are particularly interested in how the averaged error changes when $\sigma$ is contracted to $\sigma_0$ along a certain path in $F(\sigma)$. That is, given a function $\xi$ we can construct $\sigma = \sigma_0 + \epsilon \xi$ where $\xi \in F_0 = \{\xi | \norm{\xi} \leq 1 \}$. $\sigma \to \sigma_0$ is equivalent to $\epsilon \to 0$.

To measure the change rate of $E[\sigma]$ in local regime of linear function, we introduce the concept of the asymptotic error rate as follows:
\begin{definition}
Let $\xi \in F_0$, the asymptotic error rate for $\xi$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Cxi}
\mathrm{C}[\xi] \triangleq \lim_{\substack{\epsilon \to 0 \\ \sigma = \sigma_0 + \epsilon \xi}} \frac{E[\sigma] - E[\sigma_0]}{\epsilon^2}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

$\mathrm{C}[\xi]$ can represent the error change rate of perturbation from linear function. If $\mathrm{C}[\xi]$ is negative for a given $\xi$, we can decrease $\mathrm{E}[\sigma]$ in the rate of $\abs{\mathrm{C}[\xi]}$ along  the perturbation path $\xi$.
The definition of $\mathrm{C}[\xi]$ in Equation \eqref{eq:Cxi} can also be rewritten in another way as
$\mathrm{E}[\sigma] = \mathrm{E}[\sigma_0] +
\mathrm{C}[\xi]\epsilon^2 + o(\epsilon^2)$. In this form, we can see more clearly that $\mathrm{C}[\xi]$ is the coefficient of the second order term of $\mathrm{E}[\sigma]$.

To justify the definition of $\mathrm{C}[\xi]$, we need to show the limit in Equation \eqref{eq:Cxi} exists, which is guaranteed by the following proposition:
%For functional space $F$, we choose $P_m(z)$,
%which consists of polynomials with the highest degree no more than $m$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:Esigma} 
Let $\nabla \xi(\underline{z})  = \diag[\xi'(\underline{z}_1), \dots, \xi'(\underline{z}_n)]$, we have
\begin{align}\notag
\mathrm{C}[\xi]= & \E[\norm{\xi(\bm{A}\underline{Y})}^2 -
\norm{\bm{X}^\T\xi(\bm{A}\underline{Y})}^2 \\
&- \norm{\bm{X}^\T \nabla\xi(\bm{A}\underline{Y})(Y-\bm{A}\underline{Y})}^2]
\end{align}
\end{proposition}

Our goal is to get the fastest decreasing path from $E[\sigma_0]$ to $E[\sigma]$, this is equivalent to solve an optimization problem $\min \mathrm{C}[\xi]$ constraint by $\xi \in F_0$. It is hard to optimize on $F_0$ directly, and we consider $F_{0,m} = F_0 \cap P_m$ instead. $P_m$ consists of polynomials with the highest degree no more than $m$, and we have $F_0 = \lim_{m\to \infty} F_{0,m}$.

For $\xi \in F_{0,m}$ we have the following result:
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:quadratic}
If
$\xi(z) = \sum_{i=0}^m \underline{q}_i z^i$,
and $m \ll k$, then we have 
\begin{align}
\mathrm{C}[\xi] &= (1-\frac{k}{n}) \underline{p}^\T \mathbf{M} \underline{p} \notag\\
\textrm{where }\underline{p}_i &= \frac{k^{i/2}}{n^{- 1/2 + i}}\underline{q}_i\label{eq:pqt} \\
\mathbf{M}_{ij} =& -\ide{i}{j}(i-1)(j-1)(i+j-3)!! \notag
\end{align}
The constraint $\xi \in F_{0,m}$ is equivalent with
\begin{align}
\underline{p}^\T \mathbf{N} \underline{p} & = 1 \notag\\
\mathbf{N}_{ij}  & = \ide{i}{j}(i+j-1)!!
\end{align}
\end{proposition}

Proposition \ref{prop:quadratic} gives a feasible approach to choose the optimal $\xi$ by solving a quadratic optimization problem. We make the assumption $
m \ll k$ to write $M_{ij}$ in a concise form. This assumption requires that we should choose low degree polynomials as activation function and the number of node $k$ should be relatively large to represent features. Since computational cost
is proportional to the degree of polynomials and feature dimensions are usually high, our assumption does not lose practicality. 

\section{Hermite Polynomials}\label{sec:hp}

One of our major result is that we find Proposition \ref{prop:quadratic} leads naturally to the Hermite polynomials solutions. (Probabilists') Hermite polynomials $H_m(x) (m=1,2,\dots)$
are a series of polynomials with the orthogonal property $ \E[H_m(X)H_n(X)] = n! \delta_{mn}$ where $X$ is the standard normal random variable.
The highest degree of $H_m(x)$ is $m$. $\xi(z) \in F_{0, m}$ which minimizes $\mathrm{C}[\xi]$ can be expressed by Hermite polynomials in the following way:
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:value}
Let
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ximopt}
    \xi_m(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{m!n}} H_m(\frac{n}{k^{1/2}} z)
\end{equation}
Then $\mathrm{C}[\xi_m] = -(1-\frac{k}{n})(m-1) \leq \mathrm{C}[\xi] $ for all $\xi \in F_{0, m}$.
\end{proposition}
Proposition \ref{prop:value} also gives the lower bound for $\mathrm{C}[\xi]$.
It says the maximal asymptotic error rate at $\mathrm{E}[\sigma_0]$ has linear relation with the degree of Hermite polynomials. This result is made under the assumption $ m \ll k$ and in general case when $ m \ll k$ does not hold, by numerical simulation we find that $-(1-\frac{k}{n})(m-1) < \mathrm{C}[\xi]$ while $\mathrm{C}[\xi]$ decreases in linear way.

\section{Experiment Result}\label{sec:er}

To verify the change rate of $C[\xi]$ is linear as we increase the maximal degree of polynomials $m$,
we conduct a simple experiment with $n=180, k=120$. We use $\xi_m(z)$ from Proposition
\ref{prop:value} and normalized polynomials with only highest degree $\tilde{\xi}_m(z) = \frac{(nz/\sqrt{k})^m}{\sqrt{(2m-1)!!n}}$ as activation function. Using the Monte Carlo method to compute $\mathrm{C}[\xi]$ from Proposition \ref{prop:Esigma}, the result is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fixednk}. As can be seen, the Hermite polynomial results coincide with the theoretical lower bound in Proposition \ref{prop:value}. For other polynomials, it cannot achieve the minimum value but we can still see that the nearly linear relationship between $C[\xi]$ and degree $m$. From Equation \eqref{eq:pqt}, we also notice that for $\tilde{\xi}_m$, the highest degree term contributes $-(1-\frac{k}{n})\frac{(m-1)^2}{2m-1}$ to $C[\xi]$, which is approximately $\frac{1}{2} C[\xi_m]$. This phenomenon tells us that the contribution of each polynomial
degree to $C[\xi]$ is not evenly distributed and
the higher order term contributes more.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:con}

In this paper, we have investigated the mechanism of non-linearity in one-node neural network. If we allow polynomial perturbation of linear activation function,
the network loss is linearly decreased as the maximal degree of polynomial is increased. How non-linearity works in more complex neural networks will be considered in the future. 

\section{Proofs}\label{sec:Proofs}
%\appendix
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:A}
	Suppose $\bm{X}$ is uniformly distributed random orthogonal matrix and $\bm{A} = \bm{X}\bm{X}^\T$,
	then $\E[\bm{A}] = \frac{k}{n} \mathbf{I}_n$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lem:A} ]
By the symmetric property we only need to show $\E[\bm{A}_{11}] = \frac{k}{n}$ and
$\E[\bm{A}_{12}] = 0$. For the first equation, we have $n\E[\bm{A}_{11}]
= \sum_{i=1}^n \E[\bm{A}_{ii}] = \sum_{i=1}^n \E[ \sum_{j=1}^k \bm{X}^2_{ij}] =
\sum_{j=1}^k \E[\sum_{i=1}^n \bm{X}^2_{ij}]$. Since the norm of $\bm{X}_j$ is 1,
the whole summation evaluates to $k$. Therefore $\E[\bm{A}_{11}] = \frac{k}{n}$.

On the other hand, $\bm{X}$ can be treated as an $n\times k$ subblock of an $n\times n$
random orthogonal matrix $\bm{\bar{X}}$ with the property that $\bm{X}_{ij} = \bm{\bar{X}}_{ij}$
for $j\leq k$. For $\bm{\bar{X}}$, the first and second row are orthogonal:
 $\E[\sum_{j=1}^n \bm{\bar{X}}_{1j}\bm{\bar{X}}_{2j}] = 0 $ which leads to
 $\E[\bm{X}_{1j}\bm{X}_{2j}] = 0$ for $j \leq k$. Hence $\E[\bm{A}_{12}]=
 \E[\sum_{j=1}^k \bm{X}_{1j}\bm{X}_{2j}]=0$.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:linear}]
    When $\epsilon = 0$, the optimal $\underline{w}_0 = \bm{X}^\T\underline{Y}$. Therefore
    $\E[\norm{\underline{Y} - \sigma(\bm{X} \underline{w}_0)}^2] = \E[\norm{\underline{Y}-\bm{X}\bm{X}^\T\underline{Y}}^2]$.
    The expectation can be taken by $\underline{Y}$ first and then by $\bm{X}$.
    Let $\underline{Z} = (I-\bm{A}) \underline{Y}$ which transforms a Gaussian random vector $\underline{Y}$
    for given $\bm{X}$. Therefore, $\E_{\underline{Y}}[\norm{\underline{Z}}^2] = \Tr[(I-A)^\T\Cov[Y](I-A)]
    = \frac{1}{n}\Tr[I - A]$. Using Lemma \ref{lem:A}, $\mathrm{E}(\sigma) = 1 - \frac{k}{n}$ follows.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:Esigma} ]
For the problem $\min_{\underline{w}} \norm{\underline{Y} - \sigma(\bm{X} \underline{w})}$
with $\sigma = \sigma_0 + \epsilon \xi$. We can write $\underline{w} = \underline{w}_0
+ \epsilon \underline{\hat{w}} + o(\epsilon)$ where $\underline{w}_0 = \bm{X}^\T \underline{Y}$ is the minimizer for
$\epsilon = 0$. That is, we assume $\underline{w}$ can be expanded near $\underline{w}_0$
using $\epsilon$ terms. We can expand $\norm{\underline{Y} - \sigma(\bm{X} \underline{w})}$ 
up to $o(\epsilon^2)$ as
\begin{align*}
&\norm{\underline{Y} - \bm{X} \underline{w}_0 - \epsilon \bm{X} \underline{\hat{w}} -
\epsilon^2 \bm{X} \underline{\tilde{w}} - \epsilon \xi(\bm{X} \underline{w}_0 +
\epsilon \bm{X} \underline{\hat{w}}) }^2 \\
= & \norm{ \underline{Y} - \bm{X}  \underline{w}_0 -
\epsilon (\bm{X}\underline{\hat{w}} + \xi(\bm{X} \underline{w}_0 )) \\
&-  \epsilon^2(\bm{X}\underline{\tilde{w}} + \nabla \xi(\bm{X} \underline{w}_0 )\bm{X}\underline{\hat{w}})}^2 \\
= & \norm{\underline{Y}-\bm{X} \underline{w}_0  }^2 -
2 \epsilon (\bm{X} \underline{\hat{w}} +
\xi(\bm{X} \underline{w}_0))^\T (\underline{Y} - \bm{X} \underline{w}_0) +\\
& +  \epsilon^2(\norm{\bm{X}\underline{\hat{w}} + \xi(\bm{X} \underline{w}_0)}^2 \\
& -
2 (\bm{X} \underline{\tilde{w}}+
\nabla \xi(\bm{X} \underline{w}_0)\bm{X}\underline{\hat{w}})^\T(\underline{Y}-\bm{X} \underline{w}_0))
\end{align*}
$\bm{X}\underline{w}_0 = \bm{X}\bm{X}^\T \underline{Y}$ is the projection of $\underline{Y}$ onto linear subspace spanned by
columns of $\bm{X}$.

We first show that in the expansion of $\E[\sigma]$, the coefficient of $\epsilon$ is zero.
We use $\tilde{\underline{Y}}$ to denote the mirror of $\underline{Y}$ about this linear subspace.
Then we have
$\bm{X}\bm{X}^\T \underline{Y} = \bm{X}\bm{X}^\T \tilde{\underline{Y}}$ and
$(\underline{Y}- \bm{X}\bm{X}^\T\underline{Y}) = -(\tilde{\underline{Y}} - \bm{X}\bm{X}^\T \tilde{\underline{Y}})$.
The density function of $\underline{Y}$ is also symmetric about this subspace.
These symmetric properties lead to $\E_{\underline{Y}}[\xi(\bm{X}\underline{w}_0)^\T (\underline{Y}-\bm{X}\underline{w}_0)]=0$.
On the other hand, since $\bm{X}^\T \bm{X} = \mathbf{I}_k$, $(\bm{X}\underline{\hat{w}})^\T (\underline{Y}-\bm{X}\underline{w}_0) = \underline{\hat{w}}^\T (X^\T \underline{Y} - \underline{w}_0) = 0$.

Next, we minimize the coefficient of $\epsilon^2$ by $\underline{\hat{w}}$, which is simplified to 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:st}
\norm{\bm{X}\underline{\hat{w}} + \xi(\bm{X} \underline{w}_0)}^2-
2 (
\nabla \xi(\bm{X} \underline{w}_0)\bm{X}\underline{\hat{w}})^\T(\underline{Y}-\bm{X} \underline{w}_0)
\end{equation}
due to $(\bm{X}\underline{\tilde{w}})^\T (\underline{Y}-\bm{X}\underline{w}_0) = 0 $.
The expression in \eqref{eq:st} is quadratic about $\underline{\hat{w}}$. The minimum value is achieved  at
$$
\underline{\hat{w}} =  \bm{X}^\T(\nabla\xi(\bm{X}\bm{X}^\T \underline{Y})
(\underline{Y}-\bm{X}\bm{X}^\T \underline{Y}) - \xi(\bm{X}\bm{X}^\T \underline{Y}))
$$
Substituting $\underline{\hat{w}}$ in expression in \eqref{eq:st} with the above equation we can get the minimum value for the coefficient of $\epsilon^2$, which is exactly $C[\xi]$.
%\begin{align*}
%C[\xi] = & \E[\norm{\xi(\bm{X}\bm{X}^\T\underline{Y})}^2 -
%\norm{\bm{X}^\T\xi(\bm{X}\bm{X}^\T\underline{Y})}^2 \\
%& -
%\norm{\bm{X}^\T \nabla\xi(\bm{X}\bm{X}^\T\underline{Y})(\underline{Y}-\bm{X}\bm{X}^\T\underline{Y})}^2]
%\end{align*}
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:Isserlis2}
     Suppose $(X,Y)$ follows two dimensional Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\binom{0}{0}, \Sigma)$ and $ i + j $ is even, then we have
\begin{equation*}
    \E[X^i Y^j] =
    \sum_{k=0}^{\min\{i,j\}}
    \frac{\ide{k}{i} i! j!}{k! (i-k)!!(j-k)!!}
    \Sigma_{12}^k \Sigma_{11}^{(i-k)/2}\Sigma_{22}^{(j-k)/2}
\end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Using Isserlis' theorem \cite{isserlis1918formula} we obtain
$  \E[X^i Y^j] = \sum_{k=0}^{\min\{i,j\}} C_k \Sigma_{12}^k \Sigma_{11}^{(i-k)/2}\Sigma_{22}^{(j-k)/2}$. Since the power of $\Sigma_{11}$ should be an integer, $C_k = 0$ if $\ide{k}{i} = 0$. If $\ide{k}{i} = 1$, we choose $k$ items of $X$ and $Y$ to form $\Sigma_{12} = \E[XY]$, which has $\binom{i}{k}\binom{j}{k}$ choices. For the remaining $(i-k)$ numbers of $X$, we should pair them. There are $\frac{1}{(\frac{i-k}{2})!}\prod_{i=1}^{(i-k)/2} \binom{2i}{2} = \frac{(i-k)!}{(i-k)!!}$ possible combinations; For $(j-k)$ numbers of $Y$, it is $\frac{(j-k)!}{(j-k)!!}$; Finally, for $k$ pairs of $XY$, there are $k!$ possible combinations. The product $\binom{i}{k}\binom{j}{k}\frac{(i-k)!}{(i-k)!!}\frac{(j-k)!}{(j-k)!!}k!$ is the coefficient $C_k$.
\end{proof}
%\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:A1112}
%For random matrix $\bm{A}$ we have $\E[\bm{A}_{11}^t] = \prod_{i=0}^{t-1} \frac{k+2t}{n+2t}$ and
%$\E[\bm{A}_{12}^2] = \frac{(n-k)k}{(n-1)n(n+2)}$.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma:A1112}]
%Then the high order moment of $\bm{A}_{11}^t$ follows from \cite[Eq. 8]{weisstein}. To compute $\E[\bm{A}_{12}^2]$, using the symmetric property first we %have $\E[\bm{A}_{11}^2] = k\E[\bm{X}_{11}^4] + k(k-1)\E[\bm{X}_{11}^2 \bm{X}_{12}^2] \Rightarrow
%\frac{k(k+2)}{n(n+2)} = \frac{3k}{n(n+2)} + (k-1) (k \E[\bm{X}_{11}^2 \bm{X}_{12}^2])$.
%Also $\E[\bm{A}_{12}^2] = \E[(\sum_{i=1}^k \bm{X}_{11} \bm{X}_{12})^2]
%= k \E[\bm{X}_{11}^2\bm{X}_{12}^2] + k(k-1)\E[\bm{X}_{11}\bm{X}_{12}\bm{X}_{21}\bm{X}_{22}]
%$.
%Since $\sum_{i=1}^n \bm{X}_{1i} \bm{X}_{2i} = 0$, multiplying this equation by $\bm{X}_{12}\bm{X}_{22}$ and taking the expectation
%we have $\E[\bm{X}_{11}\bm{X}_{12}\bm{X}_{21}\bm{X}_{22}] = \frac{-1}{n-1} \E[\bm{X}^2_{11}\bm{X}^2_{12}]$.

%Therefore $\E[\bm{A}^2_{12}]=(1-\frac{k-1}{n-1}) \frac{k}{n(n+2)}$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:UUN}
    \begin{align}
        &\ide{i}{j} (i+j-1)!! = \sum_{k=0}^{\min\{i, j\}}
        \ide{k}{i} \ide{k}{j} \frac{i! j!}{(i-k)!!(j-k)!! k!} \label{eq:UUN} \\
             &   \ide{i}{j}(i-1)(j-1)(i+j-3)!!  \notag\\
        &=\sum_{k=0}^{\min\{i, j\}}
        \ide{k}{i} \ide{k}{j} \frac{(k-1)i!j!}{(i-k)!!(j-k)!!k!} \label{eq:UUM}
    \end{align}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma:UUN} ]
	If $ i + j $ is odd, $ \ide{i}{j} = 0 $ and
	$ \ide{k}{i}\ide{k}{j} = 0 $. Then Equation \eqref{eq:UUN} holds.
	Therefore, we only need to consider the case if $ i + j $ is even.
	First we define $A(i, j) = \sum_{k=0}^{\min\{i, j\}}
	\ide{k}{i} \ide{k}{j} \frac{i! j!}{(i-k)!!(j-k)!! k!}$.
	Then we can show that
	\begin{align*}
	& A(2i+1, 2j+1) = (2i + 1) A(2i, 2j) + (2j) A(2i+1, 2j-1)\\
	& A(2i, 2j)= (2j - 1) A(2i, 2j-2) + (2i) A(2i-1, 2j-1) 
	\end{align*}
	Then using mathematical induction we have $A(i,j) = (i+j-1)!!$ if $i + j $ is even.
	Based on our discussion on the parity of $i+j$, in general we have $A(i,j)=\ide{i}{j}(i+j-1)!!$.
	Equation \eqref{eq:UUM} follows by applying \eqref{eq:UUN}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:quadratic}]
Let $\underline{Z} = \bm{A}\underline{Y}, \underline{Z}' = (\mathbf{I} - \bm{A})\underline{Y}$. Given $\bm{X}$, $\underline{Z}$ is Gaussian vector with covariance matrix $\bm{A} \Cov[\underline{Y}] \bm{A}^\T = \frac{\bm{A}}{n}$. Similarly, $\Cov[\underline{Z}'] = \frac{\mathbf{I} - \bm{A}}{n}$. Using $\bm{A}^2 = \bm{A}$ we have $\E[\underline{Z}'\underline{Z}^\T] = 0$. That is, $\underline{Z}'$ and $\underline{Z}$ are independent, and we have $\E[f(\underline{Z}_i)g(\underline{Z}'_j)] = \E[f(\underline{Z}_i)]\E[g(\underline{Z}'_j)]$ for arbitrary function.
    
Let $\mathrm{C}_1 = \E_{\underline{Y}} [\norm{\xi(\bm{A}\underline{Y})}^2]$, $\mathrm{C}_2 
= \E_{\underline{Y}}
[\norm{\bm{X}^\T\xi(\bm{A}\underline{Y})}^2]$, $\mathrm{C}_3 
= \E_{\underline{Y}}
[\norm{\bm{X}^\T \nabla\xi(\bm{A}\underline{Y})(\underline{Y}-\bm{A}\underline{Y})}^2]$,
$\mathrm{C}[\bm{X}, \xi] :=  \mathrm{C}_1 - \mathrm{C}_2 - \mathrm{C}_3$, Then $\mathrm{C}[\xi] = \E_{\bm{X}}[\mathrm{C}[\bm{X}, \xi]]$.
We then have
\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{C}_1 &=\E[\norm{\xi(\underline{Z})}^2] = \sum_{i=1}^n \E[\xi^2(\underline{Z}_i)] \\
    \mathrm{C}_2 &= \sum_{i,j=1, i \neq j}^n \bm{\bm{A}}_{ij}\E[\xi(\underline{Z}_i)\xi(\underline{Z}_j)] +
    \sum_{i=1}^n \bm{\bm{A}}_{ii}  \E[\xi^2(\underline{Z}_i)]\\
    \mathrm{C}_3 & = \sum_{i,j=1, i \neq j}^n \bm{A}_{ij}\bm{\Sigma}_{ij} +
    \sum_{i=1}^n \bm{A}_{ii}\bm{\Sigma}_{ii}     \textrm{ where }\\
    \bm{\Sigma}_{ii} &=  \E[ [\underline{Z}'_i]^2 [\xi'(\underline{Z}_i)]^2] = \frac{1-\bm{A}_{ii}}{n}[\xi'(\underline{Z}_i)]^2   \\
    \bm{\Sigma}_{ij} &=  \E[\underline{Z}'_i \underline{Z}'_j \xi'(\underline{Z}_i)
    \xi'(\underline{Z}_j)]
     = - \frac{\bm{A}_{ij}}{n} \E[ \xi'(\underline{Z}_i)
    \xi'(\underline{Z}_j)]
\end{align*}
The expression for $\Sigma_{ij}$ holds for $i \neq j$ above. Combining the above equations we have
\begin{align*}
   &  \mathrm{C}[\bm{X}, \xi] = \sum_{i=1}^n (1-\bm{A}_{ii})(\E[\xi^2(\underline{Z}_i)] -
    \frac{ \bm{A}_{ii}}{n} \E[ \xi'^2(\underline{Z}_i)]) \\
    &- \sum_{i,j=1, i \neq j}^n \bm{A}_{ij} (\E[\xi(\underline{Z}_i)\xi(\underline{Z}_j)] -
    \frac{\bm{A}_{ij}}{n}\E[\xi'(\underline{Z}_i) \xi'(\underline{Z}_j)])
\end{align*}
By symmetric property, we can simplify the above equation as:
\begin{align*}
    &  \mathrm{C}[\bm{X}, \xi] =n(1-\bm{A}_{11})(\E[\xi^2(\underline{Z}_1)] -
    \frac{\bm{A}_{11}}{n}  \E[ \xi'^2(\underline{Z}_1)]) \\
    &- n(n-1)\bm{A}_{12}(\E[\xi(\underline{Z}_1)\xi(\underline{Z}_2)] -
    \frac{\bm{A}_{12}}{n}\E[\xi'(\underline{Z}_1)
   \xi'(\underline{Z}_2)])\nonumber
\end{align*}

Since 
$\xi(z) = \sum_{i=0}^m \underline{q}_i z^i $, we can rewrite $\mathrm{C}[\bm{X}, \xi]$
as the quadratic form $ \underline{q}^T \bm{M} \underline{q} $.
where $\bm{M}$ is an $(m+1) \times (m+1) $ random matrix 
whose element $\bm{M}_{ij}$ is given by
\begin{align*}
    \bm{M}_{ij} &= n(1-\bm{A}_{11}) (\E[\underline{Z}_1^{i+j}] -
    ij \frac{1}{n}\bm{A}_{11} \E[\underline{Z}_1^{i+j-2}])  \\
    &-n(n-1)\bm{A}_{12}(\E[\underline{Z}_1^i \underline{Z}_2^j] - ij \frac{1}{n}\bm{A}_{12}\E[\underline{Z}_1^{i-1}\underline{Z}_2^{j-1}])
\end{align*}
Since $\bm{Z}_1$ is Gaussian, we have $\E[Z_1^{2t}] = \frac{1}{n^t}\bm{A}_{11}^t (2t-1)!!$. If $\ide{i}{j} = 0$, then $\bm{M}_{ij}=0$. Otherwise,
let $ 2t = i + j $, from Lemma \ref{lemma:Isserlis2}, $\E[\underline{Z}_1^i \underline{Z}_2^j]$ can be expanded, and we have:
\begin{align*}
    &\bm{M}_{ij} = -n(1-\bm{A}_{11}) \frac{\bm{A}_{11}^t}{n^t}(i-1)(j-1)(2t-3)!! \\
    &-\frac{n(n-1)\bm{A}_{12}}{n^t}\sum_{s=0}^{\min\{i,j\}}
    \frac{\ide{s}{i}(1-s)i!j!}{s!(i-s)!!(j-s)!!}
    \bm{A}_{12}^s \bm{A}_{11}^{\frac{i - s}{2}}\bm{A}_{22}^{\frac{j - s}{2}}
\end{align*}
$C[\xi] = \E_{\bm{X}}[\mathrm{C}[\bm{X}, \xi]] =  \underline{q}^T \mathbf{M}' \underline{q}$ where $\mathbf{M}'_{ij} = \E_{\bm{X}} [\bm{M}_{ij}] = -M_1 + M_2$
and 
\begin{align*}
    M_1 & =   \frac{\E[\bm{A}_{11}^t]-\E[\bm{A}_{11}^{t+1}]}{n^{t-1}}(i-1)(j-1)(2t-3)!!, \\
    M_2 & = \frac{n-1}{n^{t-1}}\sum_{s=0}^{\min\{i,j\}}
    \frac{\ide{s}{i}(s-1)i!j!}{s!(i-s)!!(j-s)!!}
    \E[\bm{A}_{12}^{s+1} \bm{A}_{11}^{\frac{i - s}{2}}\bm{A}_{22}^{\frac{j - s}{2}}].
\end{align*}
Below we consider the case when $k, n \to +\infty$ while $m$ is finite. Since $\bm{A}=\bm{X}\bm{X}^\T$, from Proposition 7.2 of \cite{eaton1989group} we can get $\bm{A}_{11}$ is Beta distribution with parameter $B(\frac{k}{2}, \frac{n-k}{2})$.
From Theorem 1 of \cite{multivariateBeta},
$\E[\bm{A}_{11}^t]-\E[\bm{A}_{11}^{t+1}] = (1-r)\prod_{s=0}^{t-1} \frac{2s+k}{2s+n+2} \sim (1-r)r^t$ where
$ r \triangleq \frac{k}{n}$. Therefore, $M_1 \sim \frac{(1-r)r^t}{n^{t-1}}(i-1)(j-1)(2t-3)!!$.
We consider the case when $s+1$ is even, $\E[\bm{A}_{12}^{s+1} \bm{A}_{11}^{\frac{i - s}{2}}\bm{A}_{22}^{\frac{j - s}{2}}] \leq \sqrt{\E[\bm{A}_{12}^{s+1}\bm{A}_{11}^{i-s}]\E[\bm{A}_{12}^{s+1}\bm{A}_{22}^{j-s}]}$. When $k, n$ are sufficiently large, we can treat $\bm{A}_{11}, \bm{A}_{12}$ as joint Gaussian. From Theorem 2 of \cite{multivariateBeta}: $\E[\bm{A}_{12}^{s+1}\bm{A}_{11}^{i-s}] \sim s!! r^{i-s}(\frac{r(1-r)}{n})^{(s+1)/2}$. Similarly, $\E[\bm{A}_{12}^{s+1}\bm{A}_{22}^{j-s}] \sim s!! r^{j-s}(\frac{r(1-r)}{n})^{(s+1)/2}$. It implies that $\E[\bm{A}_{12}^{s+1} \bm{A}_{11}^{\frac{i - s}{2}}\bm{A}_{22}^{\frac{j - s}{2}}] \leq (s!!) r^{t-s}(\frac{r(1-r)}{n})^{(s+1)/2}$. We can get an upper bound of $M_2$ using Equation \ref{eq:UUM}: $M_2 \leq \frac{1}{n^{t-2}} (i-1)(j-1)(2t-3)!!\E[\bm{A}_{12}^{4} \bm{A}_{11}^{\frac{i - 3}{2}}\bm{A}_{22}^{\frac{j - 3}{2}}] \leq \frac{(1-r)^2 r^{t-1}}{n^t}3(i-1)(j-1)(2t-3)!!= \frac{3(1-r)}{k} M_1$.
When $k \to \infty$, we see that $M_2$ can be ignored and $\mathbf{M}'_{ij} = -\ide{i}{j}\frac{(1-r)r^t}{n^{t-1}}(i-1)(j-1)(2t-3)!!$. By changing of variables by Equation \ref{eq:pqt} we can get the correspondence $\mathbf{M}_{ij} = \frac{n^{-1+2t}}{k^t} \mathbf{M}'_{ij} = -\ide{i}{j}(1-r)(i-1)(j-1)(2t-3)!!$. 

To get the constraint on $\underline{q}$, we should choose $\norm{\xi} = 1$, which is equivalent to $\E_{\bm{X}}[\mathrm{C}_1] = 1$. By some computation we can get the expression of $\mathrm{N}$ when $ m \ll k$.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:Upem}
Let $\mathbf{U}$ be an $(m+1) \times (m+1)$ upper triangular matrix defined by
$U_{ij} = \ide{i}{j} \frac{j!}{(j-i)!!\sqrt{i!}} \textrm{ for } 0 \leq i\leq j \leq m$, $\underline{e}_m$ is an $(m+1)$ dimensional vector whose elements are zero except that the last element is 1. $\underline{p}_i = \ide{i}{m} (-1)^{(m-i)/2}\frac{\sqrt{m!}}{i!(m-i)!!}$.
Then we have $ \mathbf{U} \underline{p} = \underline{e}_m$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \ref{lemma:Upem} ]
    For $ i = m, \mathbf{U}_{mm} = \sqrt{m!}$, and we can show that $\mathbf{U}_{mm} \underline{p}_m = 1 $; For $ 0\leq i < m $ we
    will show that $ \sum_{j=i}^m \mathbf{U}_{ij} \underline{p}_j = 0 $. In specific form as
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:jimf}
    \sum_{j=i}^m \ide{i}{j} \frac{j!}{(j-i)!!\sqrt{i!}}  \frac{\ide{j}{m}(-1)^{(m-j)/2}\sqrt{m!}}{j!(m-j)!!} = 0
    \end{equation}
    If $ \ide{i}{m} = 0$, $\ide{i}{j}\ide{j}{m} = 0$ and Equation \eqref{eq:jimf} holds. Otherwise, let $2m' = m - i$,    
    and Equation \eqref{eq:jimf} is equivalent to
    $ \sum_{j=i, \ide{i}{j}=1}^m  \frac{(-1)^{(m-j)/2}}{(m-j)!!(j-i)!!}  = 0  \iff  $
    $\sum_{j=0, j \textrm{ is even}}^{2m'}  \frac{(-1)^{(2m'-j)/2}}{(2m'-j)!! j!!}= 0  \iff $
    $\sum_{j=0}^{m'}  \frac{(-1)^{m'-j}}{(2m'-2j)!! (2j)!!} = 0  \iff $
    $\sum_{j=0}^{m'}  \frac{(-1)^{m'-j}}{(m'-j)! j!} = 0  \iff \sum_{j=0}^{m'} (-1)^{m'-j} \binom{m'}{j} = 0$
    $ \iff (1+x)^{m'} = 0 \,(x=-1)$
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:value} ]
    Let $\mathbf{U}$ be the same matrix defined in Lemma \ref{lemma:Upem}. From Lemma \ref{lemma:UUN} we have $\mathbf{N}_{ij} = \sum_{k=0}^m \mathbf{U}_{ki}\mathbf{U}_{kj}$. Therefore, $\mathbf{N} = \mathbf{U}^\T\mathbf{U}$. Let $\Lambda = \diag[1, 0, -1, \dots, 1-m]$, from Equation \ref{eq:UUM} we have $\mathbf{M}_{ij} = \sum_{k=0}^m \mathbf{U}_{ki}\Lambda_{kk}\mathbf{U}_{kj}$. Therefore, $\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{U}^\T\Lambda\mathbf{U}$. Then $\min_{\underline{p}^\T N \underline{p} = 1} \underline{p}^\T \mathbf{M}\underline{p} = \min_{\underline{\tilde{p}}^\T\underline{\tilde{p}} = 1} \sum_{k=0}^m (1-k)\underline{\tilde{p}}_k^2 = 1-m$. We have made the invertible transformations $\underline{\tilde{p}} = \mathbf{U}\underline{p}$. Since the minimum value is achieved at $\underline{\tilde{p}} = \underline{e}_m$, from Lemma \ref{lemma:Upem} we have $\underline{p}_i = \ide{i}{m} (-1)^{(m-i)/2}\frac{\sqrt{m!}}{i!(m-i)!!}$. Equation \eqref{eq:ximopt} follows by transforming $\underline{p}$ back to $\underline{q}$ using Equation \eqref{eq:pqt} and comparing the expression of $\underline{q}$ with the explicit formula of probabilists' Hermite polynomials \cite[Eq. 18.5.13]{NIST:DLMF}.

% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use

% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath


% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx


% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array

% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig


% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


% *** PDF and URL PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
